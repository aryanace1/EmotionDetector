# Emotion Detector

This project is a web application that uses computer vision and deep learning to detect facial emotions in real-time. The application uses a pre-trained convolutional neural network to classify emotions based on facial expressions. Users can interact with the application by turning on their webcam with the `Play` button, taking a snapshot of their face with the `Snap` button and the application will detect their emotions in real-time.
